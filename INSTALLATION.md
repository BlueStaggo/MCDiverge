# Installation guide
This guide assists with the installation of the Minecraft Diverge mod.

## MultiMC or derivatives
1. Download the mcdiverge.zip file (not source code!) from [the latest release](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/MCDiverge/releases/latest).
2. Create a new Minecraft Alpha v1.1.2_01 instance.
3. Click on the edit button with that instance selected.
4. Click on "Add to Minecraft.jar"
5. Navigate to the downloads folder and select the Minecraft Diverge zip.
6. Minecraft Diverge can now be played on MultiMC.

## Betacraft
1. Download the .info file from [the latest release](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/MCDiverge/releases/latest) (MCDiverge-Latest.info or MCDiverge-v###.info, depends on if automatic updates are desired).
2. Move the .info file to the corresponding locations:
    - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Roaming/.betacraft/versions/jsons`
    - **Linux:** `~/.betacraft/versions/jsons`
3. Minecraft Diverge should now appear in the version list.

## Server
1. Download a Minecraft Alpha v1.1.2_01 server jar.
2. Download the mcdiverge-server.zip file from [the latest release](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/MCDiverge/releases/latest).
3. Open the Alpha 1.1.2 jar in a zip file manager (or just rename the extension to .zip and open it that way) alongside mcdiverge-server.zip.
4. Copy all the contents from Minecraft Diverge over to Minecraft Alpha v1.1.2_01. *Note: Unlike client jars, deleting the META-INF folder will break the jar.*
5. The server jar can now be run.

## Official Minecraft launcher
Good luck with that one... ;)
