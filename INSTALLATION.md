# Installation guide
This guide assists with the installation of the Minecraft Diverge mod.

## Betacraft
Minecraft Diverge appears in the Betacraft mod repository. Pick any specific version or choose the automatically updating latest stable version!

## MultiMC or derivatives
1. Download the minecraft.zip file (not source code!) from [the latest release](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/MCDiverge/releases/latest).
2. Create a new Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 instance.
3. Click on the edit button with that instance selected.
4. Click on "Add to Minecraft.jar"
5. Navigate to the downloads folder and select the Minecraft Diverge zip.
6. Minecraft Diverge can now be played on MultiMC.

## Betacraft (Manual)
1. Download the Diverge.info file from [the latest release](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/MCDiverge/releases/latest).
2. Move the .info file to the corresponding locations:
    - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Roaming/.betacraft/versions/jsons`
    - **Linux:** `~/.betacraft/versions/jsons`
3. Minecraft Diverge should now appear in the version list.

## Server
1. Download a Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 server jar.
2. Download the mcdiverge-server.zip file from [the latest release](https://github.com/BlueStaggo/MCDiverge/releases/latest).
3. Open the Beta 1.7.3 jar in a zip file manager (or just rename the extension to .zip and open it that way) alongside mcdiverge-server.zip.
4. Copy all the contents from Minecraft Diverge over to Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. *Note: Unlike client jars, deleting the META-INF folder will break the jar.*
5. The server jar can now be run.

## Official Minecraft launcher
Good luck with that one... ;)
