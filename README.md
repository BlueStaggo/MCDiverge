Minecraft Diverge is a Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 mod that will take the game towards a different direction. As this mod develops, explore new biomes, experiment with magic items and explore in a version of Minecraft, diverged! It will provide fresh new world generation, extra content for the late game and plenty of tweaks.

This is the experimental beta rework! Currently, there is no source code available as even Diverge's mappings are experimental. Once Diverge's mappings are finalized and released publicly, then a patch file will be provided.

For guidance with installing this mod, check out the [INSTALLATION](INSTALLATION.md) document. Currently, the beta rework follows a snapshot release structure.
